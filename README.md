# Cuboid Outpost ModPack

Cuboid Outpost is my first attempt at creating a ModPack for Minecraft. I hope you like it!

The basic premise is this... you're stranded on a barren planet, civilization as you knew it has come to an abrupt end, and need to recreate life as you knew it. There are a few twists and turns along the way of course!

I designed this to be more of an intermediate tech pack for those just getting into Modded Minecraft, or who are looking for something not too hard / expert. As a result, while there are quite a few mods in the pack, I've intentionally kept the number of alternatives for things low (e.g. for digital storage there's only AE2 initially, but channels are disabled to make it easier to work with - RS is available later on).

Some great content mods have been added too to keep things interesting and a bit different. And then there are a few unique mods that you won't have seen in any other pack before too - so hopefully there's something for everyone.

I've spent a lot of time working on Quests (possibly the hardest thing to get right in creating a ModPack!), and will most likely be tweaking them over the coming months once Cuboid Outpost is released (probably a few will initially be released as work in progress too).

I would really appreciate any issues you encounter while playing being reported in the Issues for the Cuboid Outpost ModPack in GitHub - I do only work on this in my (very limited) spare time, so I can't promise I'll resolve things immediately, but I do plan on trying to get around to fixing issues when I can. I would also appreciate a little bit of patience, and a civil tone when reporting issues - this is just something I'm doing for fun, for free, and in my own time, so if you could avoid sucking the life out of this experience for me by being rude or overly critical, I'd really appreciate that too!
