### Change Log for Cuboid Outpost 0.2.3

**If upgrading from a 0.1.x version**, please ensure you have a backup of your world before doing the upgrade. There should not be any problems, but as unification scripts changed, and some mods were removed, in v0.2.0, there is a very small chance you may run into a bit of trouble with upgrading from v0.1.x to v0.2.x versions of the pack.

If you already have a large number of previous ingot types in drawers, consider using an Oredictionificator from Mekanism to convert them - for smaller numbers, just hold the item(s) in your inventory instead and they should auto-convert.

## Changes Made / Issues Fixed

- Unification fixes - copper in compacting drawer now works properly (issue #39)
- Minor tweak to Tool Tinkering quests due to quest system now being able to distinguish between Tinkers axes with different materials.
- Changed description of early chests from "loses contents" to "drops contents" to be clearer on what actually happens when a chest is picked up
- Changed how durability works on Smashers to behave better with FTB Ultimine.

## Mods Updated

- CuboidDroid's Support Mod - 1.16.5-0.1.16
