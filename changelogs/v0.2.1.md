### Change Log for Cuboid Outpost 0.2.1

**If upgrading from a 0.1.x version**, please ensure you have a backup of your world before doing the upgrade. There should not be any problems, but as unification scripts changed, and some mods were removed, in v0.2.0, there is a very small chance you may run into a bit of trouble with upgrading from v0.1.x to v0.2.x versions of the pack.

## Changes Made / Issues Fixed

- Fixed issue #31: Added a crafting recipe for a Storage Drawer Concealment Key
- Fixed issue #33: Added crafting recipes for Compressed Crushed Andesite, Diorite and Granite which were missing
- Finished "Networks for XMen" chapter by adding an example for a Soul Sand Generator.
- Added a few new rewards here and there.
- Changed the double Bacon Cheeseburger quests to be just one, and replaced with a Chicken Sandwich.

## Mods Updated

- None.
