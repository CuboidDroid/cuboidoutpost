### Change Log for Cuboid Outpost 0.1.18

## Issues Fixed

- Platinum blocks and nuggets added to be in line with other ores.
- Fix for issues #26, #27 and #28 which all had to do with ore and item unification issues. This will be much better for new players of the pack in that automation will be much easier, and there will be fewer glitches in terms of things "changing shape" in your inventory. 
  
  Unfortunately this will mean that in existing worlds some items already in drawers and chests will be of the old type. Simply putting them in your player inventory will convert them to the new form, and then existing players will also be able to benefit from this improvement.

## Mods Updated

- Environmental Core - removed.
- Environmental Tech - removed.
