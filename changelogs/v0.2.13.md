## Change Log for Cuboid Outpost 0.2.13

**If upgrading from a 0.1.x version**, please ensure you have a backup of your world before doing the upgrade. There should not be any problems, but as unification scripts changed, and some mods were removed in v0.2.0, there is a very small chance you may run into a bit of trouble with upgrading from v0.1.x to v0.2.x versions of the pack.

If you already have a large number of previous ingot types in drawers, consider using an Oredictionificator from Mekanism to convert them - for smaller numbers, just hold the item(s) in your inventory instead and they should auto-convert.

## Changes Made / Issues Fixed

- Tweaked output of some recipes to match unified outputs.
- Recycler results tweaked a bit.
- Added some additional emergency quests to hopefully allow all team members to travel to additional dimensions.
- Issue #61 - as kindly suggested by adam55502, I've added a final image in the "Deliciously Creative" chapter on how to power the automated sweet roll factory very compactly using a magma block, an encased fan, and a lever.
- Issue #62 - aligned auto heavy sieve and auto compressed hammer recipes with their lighter counterparts.

## Mods Updated

- None
