## Change Log for Cuboid Outpost 0.2.8

**If upgrading from a 0.1.x version**, please ensure you have a backup of your world before doing the upgrade. There should not be any problems, but as unification scripts changed, and some mods were removed in v0.2.0, there is a very small chance you may run into a bit of trouble with upgrading from v0.1.x to v0.2.x versions of the pack.

If you already have a large number of previous ingot types in drawers, consider using an Oredictionificator from Mekanism to convert them - for smaller numbers, just hold the item(s) in your inventory instead and they should auto-convert.

## Changes Made / Issues Fixed

- SPG Flickering reduced - now continues to be lit when containing power and a valid singularity.
- Issue #47 - Dark Glass blacklisted from Molecular Recycler outputs
- Tweak Powah Energizing Orb quest text
- Added Refined Storage - gated behind Applied Energistics 2 to ensure that the early game storyline is not compromised, but at the same time giving players a choice once able to manufacture more AE2 components. No, I will not be swapping it out completely, and no, I will not be adding on additional RS-related mods. This has been done as a compromise, and no further "creep" will be introduced in the modpack in this area.

## Mods Updated

- CuboidDroid's Support Mod - 1.16.5-0.1.18
