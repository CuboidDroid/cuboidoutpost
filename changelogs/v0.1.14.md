### Change Log for Cuboid Outpost 0.1.14

## Issues Fixed

- Disabled Quark's Stick Stack to remove recipe conflict with Stick Bundle
- Removed incorrect information on alternative method for making a Bucket of Lactic Acid.
- Fixed issue #15 - gold and platinum pieces moved / added to correct place in "This is Meshed Up" chapter in appendix.
- Fixed task title for salt in the "Getting Going" chapter
- Fixed issue #14 - added salt to the unification scripts so only one salt type is dropped
- Added Deliciously Creative chapter quests (non-storyline chapter)
- Based on feedback from issue #13, Quantum Collapser now iterates over all possible inputs matching input tag, rather than just picking the first.
- Quantum Collapser amount bar in GUI now also shows the name of the item and not just the amounts.
- Mitigated an issue where renaming a Cuboid Chest was putting []'s around the name and repeating this each time the chest was moved. Now behaves itself!

## Mods Updated

- CuboidDroid's Support Mod - 1.16.5-0.1.12
