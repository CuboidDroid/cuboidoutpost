### Change Log for Cuboid Outpost 0.1.13

## Issues Fixed

- "Fix" for issue #9 - XNet cable/connector recipe lookups fail in quest tasks - added explanatory text where appropriate to say that recipes can be viewed in JEI instead.
- Removed silkworm drop from sieving leaves.
- Fix for issue #10 - inventory sorting messing up when Cuboid Machines are open
- Fix for broth recipe to use water bottle as intended rather than "uncraftable potion" so looks correct in JEI.

## Mods Updated

- CuboidDroid's Support Mod - 1.16.5-0.1.11
