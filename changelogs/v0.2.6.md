## Change Log for Cuboid Outpost 0.2.6

**If upgrading from a 0.1.x version**, please ensure you have a backup of your world before doing the upgrade. There should not be any problems, but as unification scripts changed, and some mods were removed in v0.2.0, there is a very small chance you may run into a bit of trouble with upgrading from v0.1.x to v0.2.x versions of the pack.

If you already have a large number of previous ingot types in drawers, consider using an Oredictionificator from Mekanism to convert them - for smaller numbers, just hold the item(s) in your inventory instead and they should auto-convert.

## Changes Made / Issues Fixed

- Tweaked a few quest rewards.
- Added crafting recipes to convert between red and brown mushrooms.

## Mods Updated

- None
