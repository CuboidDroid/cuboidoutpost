## Change Log for Cuboid Outpost 1.0.0

## Changes Made / Issues Fixed

- Tweaked textures to make different tier items and blocks a little easier to distinguish.
- Bumped up to full release status. My thanks to everyone who has participated in the public beta testing and the help you've given in ironing out bugs and making suggestions. Hopefully things are now stable enough for general release, and more people will enjoy playing the pack thanks to all of your contributions through the test phase. Thanks again!

## Mods Updated

- **CuboidDroid's Support Mod** - 0.2.2
