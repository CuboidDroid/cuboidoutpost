## Change Log for Cuboid Outpost 1.0.2

### Changes Made / Issues Fixed

- Issue #46 - added mixer recipe to allow for bulk creation of IE concrete.
- Issue #85 - addressed issue where some team members on servers could not access the End / Nether / final dimension correctly
- Changed recipe for the Ultimate Singularity from the auto-generated one to a custom one as the auto-generated one had issues on multi-player. Should now work in multiplayer without issues (I hope!).
- Addressed a few more unification issues (plates created using Create press now result in correct unified type)
