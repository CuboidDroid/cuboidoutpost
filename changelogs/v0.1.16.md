### Change Log for Cuboid Outpost 0.1.16

## Issues Fixed

- Warnings added w.r.t. breaking CDT with a key item does not return key item, and that key items are effectively single use. (Issue #20)
- Shifted location of outpost so that it fits neatly within a single chunk so players on servers can reduce the number of chunks they force-load. Will not affect existing saved worlds where the Outpost building has already been generated.
- Removed inventory sorting buttons due to rendering issues - inventory sorting is still available via keybinds.
- Stopped accidentally clearing out people's JEI bookmarks when upgrading
- Removed some smelting recipes that gave unintended easy / early access to gold.
- Increased effectiveness of heat sources under crucibles, and added additional heat sources. Makes production of things like obsidian, netherrack and endstone far less grindy.
- Added platinum dust - obtained from crushing / pulverizing / smooshing platinum chunks. Can be smelted to produce platnium ingots.
- SPG and SRG now only accept a single singularity in them at a time (was previously possible to have more of a single type, with no additional benefit)
