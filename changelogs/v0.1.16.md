### Change Log for Cuboid Outpost 0.1.16

## Issues Fixed

- Warnings added w.r.t. breaking CDT with a key item does not return key item, and that key items are effectively single use. (Issue #20)
- Shifted location of outpost so that it fits neatly within a single chunk. Will not affect existing saved worlds.

## Mods Updated

- None
