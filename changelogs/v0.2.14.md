## Change Log for Cuboid Outpost 0.2.14

**If upgrading from a 0.1.x version**, please ensure you have a backup of your world before doing the upgrade. There should not be any problems, but as unification scripts changed, and some mods were removed in v0.2.0, there is a very small chance you may run into a bit of trouble with upgrading from v0.1.x to v0.2.x versions of the pack.

If you already have a large number of previous ingot types in drawers, consider using an Oredictionificator from Mekanism to convert them - for smaller numbers, just hold the item(s) in your inventory instead and they should auto-convert.

## Changes Made / Issues Fixed

- Issue 63 - Fixed "Tool Tinkering" final quest rewards that broke in a previous update.
- Issue 64 - Corrected text in "DIY ... Processors" quests.
- Issue 65 - Corrected small typo in preservation chamber quest text.
- Issue 67 - Changed salt dropped from sand to be the unified type.
- Toned down the iron jetpack speeds a bit, and added more stable hover modes earlier.
- Fixed rendering of drying cupboard progress when playing in multiplayer.

## Mods Updated

- **CuboidDroid's Support Mod** - 0.2.1
