### Change Log for Cuboid Outpost 0.2.2

**If upgrading from a 0.1.x version**, please ensure you have a backup of your world before doing the upgrade. There should not be any problems, but as unification scripts changed, and some mods were removed, in v0.2.0, there is a very small chance you may run into a bit of trouble with upgrading from v0.1.x to v0.2.x versions of the pack.

## Changes Made / Issues Fixed

- Various unification fixes - uranium block for crucible heat source (issue #37), smoosher plates and dusts, etc. should now all be corrected
- Speeds of quantum collapsers corrected (previously were working a bit too fast due to me forgetting to remove setting used during development)
- Issue #38 - Wooden storage drawers in chests and drawers chapter can now be any type and not just oak.

## Mods Updated

- None
