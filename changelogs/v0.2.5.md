## Change Log for Cuboid Outpost 0.2.5

**If upgrading from a 0.1.x version**, please ensure you have a backup of your world before doing the upgrade. There should not be any problems, but as unification scripts changed, and some mods were removed in v0.2.0, there is a very small chance you may run into a bit of trouble with upgrading from v0.1.x to v0.2.x versions of the pack.

If you already have a large number of previous ingot types in drawers, consider using an Oredictionificator from Mekanism to convert them - for smaller numbers, just hold the item(s) in your inventory instead and they should auto-convert.

## Changes Made / Issues Fixed

- Issue #40 - Shift-clicking stack of singularities into SPG and SRG now moves a single singularity as expected.
- Issue #43 - Sorting of Auto-Sieve content disabled due to bug where mesh was being lost.
- Added custom recipe for Blaze Lantern as alternative to finding through exploration to avoid opportunities for server griefing.

## Mods Updated

- CuboidDroid's Support Mod - 1.16.5-0.1.17
