# Gravel Washing 101 with Create

Create adds a couple of mechanics to do with blowing air over something to affect something else. 

* Blowing air over lava will super-heat it, allowing you to bulk-smelt items dropped into the super-heated air.
* Blowing air over a campfire will heat it more gently, allowing you to bulk-cook items dropped into the heated airflow.
* Blowing air over water will allow you to wash certain items in bulk to allow you to get different results.

This tutorial deals with how to set up a very basic manually fed bulk washing solution that you can use to process Gravel into Flint and Iron Nuggets. 

In the Cuboid Outpost modpack, once you have some iron nuggets there are other ways to get iron more quickly, so a (relatively) simple solution like the one described here should be all that's needed. This solution is focussed on what you would have available in the Cuboid Outpost modpack when you need to build something like this - there are more compact and simple alternatives, and there are fully automated solutions too. However, it's up to you whether you'd like to pursue those other options... that's an exercise left to the reader if you will!

## Preparation

You will need a few things before you get started to follow along:

* 1 Water Wheel
* 1 Encased Fan
* 4 slabs (I use oak slabs, but any slab will do)
* A shaft, or a gearbox (doesn't matter if it's the vertical or horizontal kind)
* 2 buckets of water
* About a stack of building blocks - I've used Cellulose Bricks and Glass, but you could use anything solid really
* Some Gravel to process (a stack should be plenty to ensure you get some iron nuggets)

Once you've got the above, you're ready to build...

## Step 1 - the backdrop

Build yourself a 3 high and 5 wide wall, and place the water wheel onto the exact middle block as show in the picture below.

## Step 2 - Retaining walls

The next step is to put 3 blocks vertically on each end to stop water from running out. You should also take note of the direction that the paddles on the water wheel are facing - we're going to want the water to flow across the top of the water wheel into the paddles (it's important to get this bit right). Once you know the direction you want the water to flow, place a slab on the top half of the middle block on the side where your water source will be. If your paddles are facing the other direction in your build, simply put the slab on the other side.

Optionally, you can dig out the block at ground level under the slab so that it looks like the water is flowing out somewhere, but it's just for aesthetics.

## Step 3 - cover the front

Next, cover the front, leaving the middle block clear so that you will be able to access the water wheel as your source of rotational force. I've used some glass so that you can see what's going on, but you don't have to if you don't want to.

## Step 4 - Add the water

Use a bucket of water to place the source block of water above the slab. The water should flow across the top of the water wheel, down the side, and then back under the water wheel. This configuration provides the maximum rotational force that the water wheel can provide.

## Step 5 - attaching the Encased Fan

At this point, you're ready to attach the encased fan. Start off by attaching a shaft to the water wheel, and then attach the encased fan to the shaft. 

<img src="images\Gravel-Washing-5A.png" alt="Encased fan attached with a shaft" style="width:50%;" />

If the white air particles flow away from the contraption, you can move to Step 6 now. However, if the air particles are being sucked toward the contraption, you will need to replace the shaft with a gearbox. Gearboxes reverse the direction of rotation when used like this, and so the fan should start blowing away from the contraption with one in place.

Make sure the white air particles are flowing away from the water wheel / contraption, and then you should move to step 6.

## Step 6 - lay out a platform

Place 5 building blocks in a line, starting under the encased fan, and under the flow of the air particles. On the 5th block, build up one more block.

## Step 7 - make the platform wider

Place another row of 5 blocks on either side of the base you just placed down to complete the platform.

## Step 8 - making a water trap

To perform bulk washing, we will need to place down some water for the air to flow through. We don't want the water to flow out over everything, however, and so we can simply trap it in place. One of the easier ways of doing this is to surround the block we will be placing the water onto with something to hold the water in place. Slabs work just fine for this. Note that the ones to either side can be solid blocks, but the one that the air travels through cannot be a solid block.

## Step 9 - Placing the water & checking the particle colour

You can now place down water in front of the encased fan. If you've done everything correctly, the air particles will be coming out blue, which indicates that it is ready to wash any appropriate items thrown into the stream of air.

<img src="images\Gravel-Washing-9.png" alt="Water placed - checking for blue particles" style="width:67%;" />

## Step 10 - toss in some gravel and step back

At this point you can drop your gravel into the blue particles. Step back to ensure you don't accidentally pick them up again. You'll know it's working because there will be some additional white particles too. Remember that getting flint and iron nuggets is chance based, so you might just want to toss in a whole stack at once.

## Step 11 - wait for the washing to complete

After a few seconds, the gravel should disappear, and be replaced with flint and/or iron nuggets. If you threw in a whole stack of gravel, there should hopefully be a bit of both. If you only threw in one piece of gravel, you could end up with both, one, or neither (it's a chance based process).

## Step 12 - Enjoy the fruits of your labour!

At this point, you should have some gravel and iron nuggets.

<img src="images\Gravel-Washing-12.png" alt="One stack gravel = 25 flint and 5 iron nuggets" style="width:80%;" />

In testing this build, I got 25 flint and 5 iron nuggets from a stack of gravel. While this is not an amazing return in the short-term, if you can automate it, this system can produce infinite iron for you.

## Fin.

In the Cuboid Outpost modpack, you can use the iron nuggets in other ways to more rapidly produce more iron, so you're done if you want to be!

If you're reading this for use in another modpack, or you'd like to do something a little more fancy, you could think about other ways of automating this - perhaps by replacing the "stopper block" with a 1x2 storage drawer (if in the pack you're playing), placing a flint and a nugget in the drawers (to ensure the gravel doesn't end up in there), and attaching an andesite funnel so that the washed materials get put into the drawers, but the gravel stays in place until washed. You could use crushing wheels to turn cobble into gravel and have it drop into place, and you could produce cobble using a cobble gen and drills. There are a few really good tutorials on this - just go searching in YouTube for "minecraft create infinite iron" and you should find plenty of inspiration!

I hope you've found this very basic tutorial useful!
