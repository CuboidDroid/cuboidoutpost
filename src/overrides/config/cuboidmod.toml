#Molecular Recycler Settings
#
#  The Molecular Recycler is essentially similar to the concept of uncrafters,
#  but is intentionally designed to be imperfect. What it attempts to do, with the
#  default configuration, is recursively break down ingredients based on crafting
#  recipes that result in the item being recycled. The number of steps it will take
#  is determined by [qtc.max_recycling_steps] and defaults to 3. Increasing this will
#  increase the likelihood that the outputs are going to be really basic! e.g. more
#  likely to be nuggets than ingots, or any familiar ingredients given the input.
#
#  For example, an oak fence gate requires 4 sticks and 2 oak planks. If you put in
#  an oak fence gate, you won't get back all 4 sticks and 2 oak planks - instead you
#  will most likely get back less than that.
#
#  For each final ingredient type, the Molecular Recycler uses the following formula
#  to determine your chances of getting back each of the input materials:
#
#    - For the first [qtc.guaranteed_amount] items of a particular type, you will get
#      back [qtc.guaranteed_count] of that item with 100% certainty. By default, these
#      are 4 and 3 respectively, which means that for any item where there were 4 or
#      more ingredients identified by the recycler, you will get back 3 of the first 4.
#    - For the next 2 items of a particular type, there is a 80% chance of getting (up to) 2 back
#    - For the next 2 items of a particular type, there is a 60% chance of getting (up to) 2 back
#    - For the next 2 items of a particular type, there is a 50% chance of getting (up to) 2 back
#    - For the remainder of items, for each of the next 2 items of a particular type,       there is a 25% chance of getting (up to) 2 back
#
#Note that we use (up to) 2 because if at any stage there is only 1 left, then the logic will apply
#to just that one remaining item.
#
#Yes - it's confusing, and possibly a bit harsh, but this is not meant to be a lossless uncrafter!
#
#Going back to the oak fence gate example, 4 sticks and two oak planks - assuming default settings -
#this would result in 3 sticks, and an 80% chance of getting back 2 oak planks.
#
#Another example is an Iron Chest from the Iron Chests mod. To make it you need a vanilla chest 
#(8x planks) and 8 iron ingots. The planks would not break down further, so would result in 3 of 
#the first 4 being guaranteed, then an 80% chance of 2 and a 60% chance of 2. The iron ingots, however
#would be broken down again into iron nuggets - 72 of them. The first 4 would give back a guaranteed 3
#then 2 at 80% chance, 2 at 60% chance, 2 at 50% chance, and the remaining 62 would be as 31 rolls of
#2 at 25% chance... if you're really, really unlucky, you might only get back 3 planks and 3 nuggets!
#It should be fairly clear that this machine is a mixed blessing, and should be used with caution!
#
#NOTE: When it comes to recycling items with multiple recipes (or their results when recursively
#      recycling), the recipe with the most ingredients is chosen as a preference. This is not
#      currently configurable.
