				"If you're wondering how to get a Cow in a Jar, you'll need 4 things... a Milk Jar next to a wall, a cow standing on top of the Milk Jar, and an Anvil to place above the cow (hence the wall - it's easier that way!). The Anvil will fall onto the cow, and force it into the bottle. Don't worry though... it's totally safe! The cow will slowly produce milk forever, making it a useful (if slow) way of getting the milk you need for this factory."

				"We recommend, however, that you place down the storage drawer first, and put in the Sweet Roll you kept aside. This will ensure that only Sweet Rolls can be moved off the belt and into the drawer. You could then swap out the Brass Funnel for an Andesite one if you wish, or stick with a brass version (like we did) simply because it looks better. Just attach the funnel to the side of the drawer facing the belt, and that should work just fine."

If you find that things are going backwards, you should really only need to put in an extra gearbox between the source of rotational force and this contraption, or connect to a different Cog Wheel."
