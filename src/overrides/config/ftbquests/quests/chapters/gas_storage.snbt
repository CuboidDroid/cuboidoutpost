				"More often than not, it's not the gas you're interested in - it's what it gets used to produce. However, it can be important in many multi-machine setups (whether involving gas or not) to have some sort of buffer to allow your processes to run more smoothly."
				""
				"The Chemical Tanks here also have options to dump excess, which means they can be configured to automatically void any extra gas if they get too full - which is really useful, assuming the gas is not toxic!"
