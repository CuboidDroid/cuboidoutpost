				"This can be useful in situations where a system is in place where items keep coming in, but you don't need to keep them all. For example, there might be a secondary output from an automated process where you only want the main process to back up when another drawer (without this upgrade) is full, but you don't want the secondary item to back up and bring the process to a stop, so the secondary output is put into a drawer with this upgrade on it, which means any excess just gets destroyed and the process can continue filling up the main drawer."

				"Another good use case is on Mob Drops from a mob farm - you definitely don't want tons of items collecting on the ground, and you don't want to have to store them all, so store some in a drawer, and let the excess be destroyed by this upgrade."
