				"Fluid extractors need to be placed facing a log. Have a look at the uses of a Fluid Extractor to see the list, but the thing you should know is that different types of wood produce different amounts of Latex, and Acacia is king in this regard! When correctly positioned, the Fluid Extractor will (very) slowly start destroying the log placed in front of it, sucking out all of the Latex and putting it into its internal tank."

				"You'll very quickly notice that the Fluid Extractor runs quite slowly! There are a few ways you can speed this up..."
				""
				"Firstly, you can use more than one Fluid Extractor - you can even have up to 4 facing the same log to save space."
				""
				"Secondly, while the Fluid Extractor doesn't require power, it does run marginally quicker with power supplied."
				""
				"To complete this task, you just need a bucket of latex. If you're using more than one Fluid Extractor, it might be a good idea to make yourself something like a Common Black Hole Tank (which can hold 16 buckets of fluid) and pipe the Latex from your Fluid Extractors into the tank - that way you'll get your bucket full sooner, and will also have a buffer between your Latex production and Latex consumption later on."
