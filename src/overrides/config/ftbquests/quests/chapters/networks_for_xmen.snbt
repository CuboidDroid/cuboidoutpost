This means that if the chest (which is set to extract on channel 1) has Gold Ingots, 1 will be moved into the Energizing Orb if there isn't already a Gold Ingot in there, but if there is one, then additional ones will not be inserted."

For example, channel 3 could extract from the chest and insert Blaze Powder (with a 4 in the # box) into the new Orb, that could have a new Energizing Rod assigned to it, and you can then set the extract on channel 7 for the orb to put the result (Blazing Crystal) back into the chest. Alternatively just duplicate the setup and have one of this sort of setup for each Energizing Orb output you're after (which would be simpler to manage for sure, if a bit more expensive)"
