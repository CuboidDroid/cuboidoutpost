				"The 1k Storage Cell can store 1k Bytes of items digitally, with a maximum of 63 different types of items."
				""
				"The key thing to remember is that each Storage Cell in the Applied Energistics digital storage system can hold a maximum of 63 different item types (e.g. if you have 2 Storage Cells, then your system can hold, at most, 126 different types of items)."
				""
				"In practice this means that if you want to store lots of different items with low quantities, then you'll want lots of 1k Storage Cells to maximise the number of available types in your storage system."
				""
				"Conversely, if you want to store a small number of item types in large quantities, then you would be better off with 64k Storage Cells as they're more efficient to make and take up less room (i.e. you won't need as many ME Drives to house them)."
				""
				"In reality, over time it is likely that you will want a good mixture of different size Storage Cells to cover all the bases."
