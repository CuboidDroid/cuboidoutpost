				"Universal cables can be configured using a Configurator. By default, when the cables are placed down, they will attempt to connect to anything they can, and will allow energy to flow in any direction. This is usually what you want, but in some cases, you might want to change this behaviour. Using the configurator, you can change a connection to only allow energy to be pulled, pushed, or even be disconnected for a particular direction that the cable connects in."
